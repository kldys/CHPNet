## Introduction

The proposed lightweight image reconstruction network integrates a compact architecture with a knowledge distillation framework to balance efficiency and reconstruction quality. The model employs a dynamic adjustment mechanism to improve the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, ensuring robust performance even in resource-constrained environments.

Key contributions include:
1. A lightweight architecture that reduces computational cost and accelerates inference.
2. A knowledge distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from a powerful teacher network to a compact student network.
3. A dynamic adjustment mechanism that enhances the learning capacity of the student network during training.
